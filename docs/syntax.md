# Syntax

First, prepare a spec file, e.g. `ssh_connection.ispec`:

```
% whoami
root
% pwd
/root
```

Then, run it:

```
$ python -m test tests/ssh_connection.ispec
PASS % whoami
PASS % pwd
```

## Config File

Shellinspector can be configured within a project using a file called
`shellinspector.yaml` somewhere up the directory tree relative to your `.ispec`
file. Only the first/nearest config file found will be considered. The search is
also stopped, if a `.git` directory is found, assuming this is the project root.

You can use all settings available in Frontmatter here.

```
settings:
  timeout_seconds: 10
  include_dirs:
    - includes/
  fixture_dirs:
    - fixtures/
```

All given relative paths are relative to the `shellinspector.yaml` file itself.

## Frontmatter

Shellinspector can be configured in various ways outlined below. These config
values are set using an optional YAML section at the start of the file. This
takes precedence over the values provided in the config file. The `settings`
dict gets merged, all other values are overwritten completely.

```
---
environment:
  A: B
---
% whoami
root
% pwd
/root
```

All given relative paths are relative to the directory of the current spec file.

## Test Syntax

All lines (except expected output) start with a prefix character (`P`), followed
by arguments (`command`). The following lines specify an expected output
(`expected out put ...`).

```
P command
expected
output
...
```

## Fixtures

This setting can be used to define a set of commands that are run before and
after the actual test commands. The fixture is defined in two separate files,
e.g. `fixtures/user_create_pre.ispec` and `fixtures/user_create_post.ispec`.
You can then use the fixture like so, in `test.ispec`:

`_pre`:

```
% useradd testuser
```

`_post`:

```
% userdel testuser
```

```
---
fixture: user_create
settings:
  fixture_dirs:
    - fixtures/
---
% test -d /home/testuser
```

The `_pre` fixture is run before the first command in `test.ispec`, the `_post`
fixture is run after the last command, even if something failed.

### Run commands

To plainly interact with the shell as the root user or from within an uberspace,
start the line with `$` (user) or `%` (root):

```
% whoami
root
$ whoami
someuser
```

#### Matching

The lines following the command line are compared to the stdout & stderr the
command prints out. There are multiple

##### Literal Match

Ensure the output of the command matches the specified exactly:

```
% head -n2 /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/usr/bin/nologin
```

Note that there is always a final new line after the expected output, so this
will currently always fail:

```
$ echo -n a
a
```

##### Regex Match

Interpret the specified output as a regex with `re.MULTILINE` and try to match
it:

```
%~ ls /home
.*testuser.*
%~ cat /etc/passwd
^testuser
$~ whoami
\Atestuser\Z
```

Keep in mind that `\A` and `\Z` (not `^` and `$`) are needed to match start and
end of the regex.

New lines are only preserved between lines, but not after the final one.
Otherwise this would never match, since `r"aaaa\n"` can't match `aaaa`.

```
$~ echo aaaab
aaaa
```

##### Ignore

To just discard and ignore the output, use `_`:

```
%_ ls /home
%
```

### Includes

If a set of command repeates over and over in different spec files, you can
extract it into a dedicated file to be used in different files. For example,
creating a user happens over and over. Put it into `create_user.ispec`.

```
% uberspace user create -u testuser
```

Then, include it into other files by using `<` and the path. The given path
is relative to the paths listed in the `include_dirs` key in the config file,
plus the directory of the current spec file, in that order.

```
< create_user.ispec
% ls /home
testuser
```

### Comments

Any lines starting with `#` are ignored:

```
# the next line will run the command `echo`:
$ echo a
a
# this line does nothing
# EOF
```

## Target user & machine

By default commands run inside the uberspace8 VM as the specified user (`%` for
root, `$` for the user last specified). To override this, expand the lines to
look like a shell prompt:

```
# run on the local dev/ci machine
[@local]$ hostname
luto-portable
# run as a different user on uberspace8 VM
[usr1@remote]$ whoami
usr1
# run as the user last specified, in this case usr1
$ whoam
usr1
```

Using `$` without a specified user as the first `$`-command will cause a random
username like `t1234567` to be used. The username is constant per .spec file.
Keep in mind that this test user is not actually created on the host. You have
to create it yourself based on the username in `$SI_TEST_USER`.

## Sessions

You can connect to the test host more than once by adding `:session_name` to the
username. Here we connect twice, change into two different directories and then
check that the sessions are still separate:

```
[vagrant:session1@remote]$ cd photos
[vagrant:session2@remote]$ cd videos
[vagrant:session1@remote]$ pwd
/home/vagrant/photos
[vagrant:session2@remote]$ pwd
/home/vagrant/videos
```

## Logout

Use the `logout` command to terminate a session. If you use the same
user/session-name/host again, a new one will start automatically.

```
[@local]$ echo a
a
[@local]$ logout
[@local]$ echo b
b
```

## Return Codes

Exit codes of all commands are checked automatically. If the code is >0, the
command is considered a failure:

```
$ python -m test false.ispec
running false.ispec
FAIL $ test -d /etc/nonexistant
command failed (RC=1)
```

To ignore the check, hide the return code like so:

```
$ test -d /etc/nonexistant || true
```

## Environment

To set envrionment variables for this test run, add an `envrionment` key to the
frontmatter:

`test.ispec`:

```
---
environment:
  DNS_SERVER: 1.1.1.1
---
$ echo $DNS_SERVER
1.1.1.1
```

## Parametrized tests

To run many similar tests, add an `examples` key to the frontmatter:

`test.ispec`:

```
---
examples:
  - PY_EXE: python3.11
    PY_VERSION: 3.11
  - PY_EXE: python3.13
    PY_VERSION: 3.13
---
$~ {PY_EXE} --version
{PY_VERSION}
```

## Python code

Sometimes shellinspector checks are not enough, so you can also run python
snippets like so:

`test.ispec`:

```
! check_postgres_connection("testy")
[@local]! set_env("did_python_run", "it did")
[@local]$ echo $did_python_run
it did
```

`test.ispec.py`

```python
def set_env(context, key, value):
    context.env[key] = value
    return True
```

The extra argument `ctx` is of type `ShellinspectorContext`, you can use the
following attributes:

- `.applied_example`, `dict`, (readonly): current config, see "Parametrized tests".
- `.env`, `dict`, (read/write): shell environment variables.

Return `True` to let this command pass, return error message as non-empty str
to fail. Other values will error.

Note that even though `[@local]!` specifies a host and user, the python code is
always executed on the control machine. The host/user spec only determines which
session is used for `ctx.env`.

## Examples

```
# Create a user and check the default python version
< create_user.ispec
$~ python --version
^Python 3.10
$~ pip --version
^pip.*python 3.10
```
